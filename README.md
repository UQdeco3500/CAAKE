# Long Distance Relationships - Communication and Connection between Parents and Students

Welcome to the Framilia Physical Prototype README! Framilia is a unique solution designed to enhance emotional connections between international students and their parents, bridging the gap of long-distance relationships. This document will provide an overview of the physical prototype and how it connects with digital photos and videos to create a meaningful interaction. 

To learn more about the development process of Framilia as well as more information on how it works check out our wiki:

The Framilia physical prototype is a specially designed holographic frame. Its primary purpose is to display images and videos to create a more tangible and immersive experience for users. Our system consist of a digital application as well as a physical prototype:

**Physical Artefact**

The physical prototype is a frame that employs holographic technology to project images, messages or videos users recieve from their parent / child (vice versa). By projecting the shared content, the frame creates an immersive experience for the user to feel their present with their loved ones, even when physically distnant. The frame allows the asyhnchronous interaction that allow users to send message and media at their convinience which is helpful for international students and parents who may be in different time zones.

To use it, place a phone on top of the holder which cycles through images (works best with dark backgrounds). The Holo must be placed in a dark lighting setting for optimat effect.

**Mobilie Application**

In terms of the accompanied mobile application, it serves as the control centre for users to send, manage and personalise the content displayed on the paired user. With the app, users can choose what to send which will be delivered to the other Framilia. The Framilia and app work together seamlessly to create a unique emotional connection between international students and their parents. In this way, they can come together to bridge the gap between international students and their parents, making them feel more connected, regardless of the physical distance.
